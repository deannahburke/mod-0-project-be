# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/booleans.rb``

# EXAMPLE: print to the terminal the result of 1 is equal to 2:
p 1 === 2

# EXAMPLE: print to the terminal the result of 7 is greater than 2:
p 7 > 2

# YOU DO: print to the terminal the result of "hello" is equal to "Hello":
p "hello" === "Hello"

# YOU DO: print to the terminal the result of 3 is not equal to 4:
p 3 != 4
# unsure if this is the correct way to notate 'not equal to' in Ruby but it did give me the desired input!

# YOU DO: print to the terminal the result of 4 is less than or equal to 5:
p 4 <= 5

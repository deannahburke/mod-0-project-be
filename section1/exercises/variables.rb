# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
puts "#{name} must not return to Hogwarts!"

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = 22 + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22 - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Deannah"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 2
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets



# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

#I decided to use a string for the first_name variable, I wanted to honor the data of the first name exactly as it was (Thank you to Cydnee in session 4 for describing it this way!). For is_hungry, I figured I was suppsoed to use a different type of data besides string, and neither integers nor floats apply to if one is hungry or not.  One either is or is not hungry, which is essentially true or false, so I chose a boolean for this data type.  Lastly, for number_of_pets I chose to use an integer as a positive and whole number to describe the number of pets I have (2 cats that have already made some Zoom appearances).
# Explain.

# I am unsure what to explain here? **Casey, ideas?**


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jeni"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets



# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

total_number_of_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
p total_number_of_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?

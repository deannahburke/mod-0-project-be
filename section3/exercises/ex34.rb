#With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)
#In this case, 2010 is part of a string of data rather than a position in an index base.  Also, when I think about the way time and years work, I think about age.  When you are born, you are 0 years old, and you remain 0 years old until you've been alive for one year and turn 1.  The first year of your life is essentially your 'zeroth' year in an index.

#Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
#Use Ruby to check your answers.
